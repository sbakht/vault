I told padela today about diapers. He was quite accepting. I feel good. But I told him cause I already felt good beforehand, not sad like the other times I wanted to tell someone.

I really like diapers and dont want to give them up

It is rather complex swing set of back and forth to sus out the inner machnimations of truth within us. https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/emotional-translation/ I skim this url, cause I'm scared of really reading and feeling something. Skimming lets me ignore the truth. I'm so good at it I'm convinced I have the truth when I don't. Yes Islam is the truth but my manifestation of it is nothing but a lie. Any insult i make of abdl is just a lie to protect myself from tthe truth, the truth that I LOVE BEING A BABY. I WANT TO WEAR DIAPERS 24/7. I WANT SOMEONE TO CHECK MY DIAPERS AND CHANGE ME WITH NO VOILITION OF MY OWN. I want 0 privacy when it comes to my infantile behaviors. I want to be checked in public. I want a full nursery with changing table, infinite supply of diapers, crib, and everything else. I want this nursery not because I want to be treated like a baby, but because I NEED it and its simply the easiest way to take care of me. I want diapers, pacis, and changing mats to be all around the house cause its just easier for mommy to change me wheerever we are. This is the truth. What is also true is that were I to get this, I would want something else, or I wouldn't like parts or all of it. The truth is this is what I think I want, but I really don't know what I truely want. What is it that someone truley wants anyway? Is truth in desires what I think my desires are, or is there a difference?

I find it so easy to write so much about diapers like written above, but nothing else. I feel like I'm speaking from the heart (or maybe the penis) when I write it. I want to tell ayesha about my desire to be her baby because I want accceptance, and I want to be her baby. I want her to say "I would love nothing else then to diaper you like a sweet little baby". 

My stomatch is pulsing.

**How would you feel if ayesha said my desire to wear diapers and be a baby is digusting?**

I would feel rejected and alone. I would get angry and be mad at diapers, probably cry and throw a tantrum by throwing diapers on the ground and stomping my feet. I wrote that descriptive line to avoid the emotion. Doing a tantrum like a baby is something I can get behind, but harder without the baby behaviors. If she is encouraging and likes it, I would feel cared for and validated. I would feel immense love for her, I would want to hug her. I would feel that she could be my mommy. I would smile. I would be 10x attracted to her. What if she was intrigued, and was willing to see where this goes but was reserved about it? I would be kinda sad. I hope she would want to be mommy and I would assume the worst. From a action pov I'd proceed and give her time to process it, but it would constantly be on my mind, worrying about what will happen. I would have hope, hope that she could be my mommy. I'm scared that I will take too much of a submissivie and baby role, and fail to be a husband. I only fear this if she takes the mommy role. If she is against it, I can't marry her, I would have resentment. I would feel that she hates a part of me, the deeper inside of me that needs love. My baby side needs love and care. I crave the unconditional attention and touch from mommy. It has to be unconditional. Can I work through this so I don't need unconditional love anymore?

Frankly I'm scared to not want diapers anymore. Which is why I shy away from dua for taking it away. If I'm scared to not want diapers, they must be a safety blanket for me. Awww which is what I just said in my head. I actually just had an emotional happy and smiled that diapers are an actual safety blanket for me. Is that validation I just got? Validation that I have some sort of legit (emotional) dependency on diapers? Its cute that I can rely on diapers and stuffies in this way.
