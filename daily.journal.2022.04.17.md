## Emotional processing from universalman

i dont want to look at my phone since im scared of what i will see
what are you scared of? negative response, rejection, spiked anxiety levels, spiked anger levels, regret
Looking at my phone will make me feel bad

Its very true, it will make me feel some bad emotion.
I already feel bad, so is looking worse? It can be worse but its just another emotion that I can process. I need to be able to face it to fix the problem. Ignoring it will only fester the pain and i will feel bad for the rest of the time until i look. Looking now is better because it resolves this inner tension that exists. It will create a new emotion but i can redo this processing to resolve that one next.
