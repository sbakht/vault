1. Intro: Purpose, Potential, & Happiness

I find it very difficult to keep my focus on the akirah. Like I try to avoid bad, and do good but I'm far more motivated to avoid sins then do good deeds. This modern world that we live in where kufr is rampent and the secular ideology dominates across the global, it is quite difficult to keep my head on straight. Just like everyone else to some degree or another, my entire brain's premises fall upon kufr. Islam is then superimposed on top of that. This leads to a sort of intellectual-only Islam that must consiously be brought to the forefront of my thoughts to direct correct beliefs and action. Any let up of self-awareness leads to the kufr modality directing my actions. This is the core issue of Islam being a "religion" in the modern world, and not the underpinning of our worldview.

2. Truth in a Post-Truth World

Honestly my reflection from the first part could apply here just as well. Modernity in many ways has destroyed the concept of truth, as well as right or wrong. No doubt there are things that are still considered true, and things that are still considered wrong. But many things have broken down. The separation of gender from sex is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. We are at a stage where people are convinced they are the other gender, and the medical industry will gladly push foward this ideology so they can perform surgeries, prescribe pills and do evaluations that make them more money. The only truth left seems to be that money and power is all one should chase. What is worse is that one who is transgender, fully believes they are the other gender, to the point of suicide. I struggle with something that isn't this, but I understand the challenge. Words have meaning. They prescribe a concept. If a word does not exist, then that concept does not exist. The reason we see so many lgbtq+ people is that these are new concepts that one is given the option of. Concepts implant ideas in the mind, an idea that a given person may be subsciptble to depending on their past experiences and personality. Concepts are also something Iblees will take advantage of to whisper ideas. This also it to grow like a tumor if it is not stopped. The problem is our community is completly inept and infantile at stopping ideas from growing. They think yelling, beating and ignoring the elpehant in the room will just make the problems go away. "Its just in your head", "Stop thinking about it". This all stems from the fact we don't know ourselves. We have to rely on the psychology of secularists to understand ourselfs. Look at the self help industry. Muslims don't know themselves so they cant help themselve or anyone else. We ignore our emotions cause we are terrified of thinking something even remotely related to haraam. The fear paralizes us and our communities fail to go anywhere.

3. The Final Messenger

I've found that the Prophet's (pbuh) personality and ctions to be the best miracle. No one, not even the haters have any criticism against his interaction with other people. Social interaction is one of those things that is impossible to get right in every situation because we all have our own personalities that aren't conducive to every situation. The fact that he dealt with everyone in the best way so that each person thought they were the most loved by the Prophet (pbuh), is really the best miracle.

4. The Final Message

This is the reason I'm on the journey to learn Arabic. To understand what I'm reading without translation and to be able to witness the miraculous nature of the Quran everyday. 

5. #Goals

Goals are tough for me. I got a number of goals but I'm really bad at turning them into SMART goals being consistent at it. I'm very much like the wind in that I'll get super into a project/activity/goal, but then I can quickly stop caring and move on to something else. I eventually come back to it later. My goal is to try to leverage this and work with it, instead of against it. I've learned that working against your nature doesn't end well. Its better to take your strengths and modify things to take advantage of them. I should make a goal to figure out the best way to set goals for me. What I can do is make a smaller goal, but don't trivialize that goal. When I code, I'm really good at it since I can focus on small tasks. Those small tasks all add up to a big goal.

6. Wealth

Weath is a tricky one for me. Like I like to save alot, which is good, but my default is to not spend. There is good in this in that I don't buy wasteful things constantly, but ofcourse it has a downside. The primary downside is that it effects how I interact with other people. Like other people want to do an activity, or buy something that impacts me as well, but I don't think its worth it cause im more money consious. So I start to think that is me spending money on this then a form of charity or can I justify it as increasing social relationships? Is there some good in it that increases its value other then just money? Money isnt the only criteria to assess value.

7. Mortality Salience

Whenever I think about death, I become sad and guilty because I feel like I'm not doing enough or a good enough job, which is true in some respects. It is also not true in some respects. Balancing this is hard just like balancing anything is hard. That negativity becomes overwelhming and then I just tune out. I get overwelhmed easily just like I do if I have too many tasks or things to do. What I should do is focus on the positive aspects like forgiveness, then look at how I can make 1 change to try to improve things. Its like a self experiment where I keep changing 1 thing and see if it works for me to do more good and avoid the bad.
