1. Intro: Purpose, Potential, & Happiness

I find it very difficult to keep my focus on the akirah. Like I try to avoid bad, and do good but I'm far more motivated to avoid sins then do good deeds. This modern world that we live in where kufr is rampent and the secular ideology dominates across the global, it is quite difficult to keep my head on straight. Just like everyone else to some degree or another, my entire brain's premises fall upon kufr. Islam is then superimposed on top of that. This leads to a sort of intellectual-only Islam that must consiously be brought to the forefront of my thoughts to direct correct beliefs and action. Any let up of self-awareness leads to the kufr modality directing my actions. This is the core issue of Islam being a "religion" in the modern world, and not the underpinning of our worldview.

2. Truth in a Post-Truth World

Honestly my reflection from the first part could apply here just as well. Modernity in many ways has destroyed the concept of truth, as well as right or wrong. No doubt there are things that are still considered true, and things that are still considered wrong. But many things have broken down. The separation of gender from sex is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. We are at a stage where people are convinced they are the other gender, and the medical industry will gladly push foward this ideology so they can perform surgeries, prescribe pills and do evaluations that make them more money. The only truth left seems to be that money and power is all one should chase. What is worse is that one who is transgender, fully believes they are the other gender, to the point of suicide. I struggle with something that isn't this, but I understand the challenge. Words have meaning. They prescribe a concept. If a word does not exist, then that concept does not exist. The reason we see so many lgbtq+ people is that these are new concepts that one is given the option of. Concepts implant ideas in the mind, an idea that a given person may be subsciptble to depending on their past experiences and personality. Concepts are also something Iblees will take advantage of to whisper ideas. This also it to grow like a tumor if it is not stopped. The problem is our community is completly inept and infantile at stopping ideas from growing. They think yelling, beating and ignoring the elpehant in the room will just make the problems go away. "Its just in your head", "Stop thinking about it". This all stems from the fact we don't know ourselves. We have to rely on the psychology of secularists to understand ourselfs. Look at the self help industry. Muslims don't know themselves so they cant help themselve or anyone else. We ignore our emotions cause we are terrified of thinking something even remotely related to haraam. The fear paralizes us and our communities fail to go anywhere.
