## Not Doing

## Journal

Today I listned to dr k and woke up, and didnt look at my phone for almost an hour and a half. I did osme thinking and went for a walk and did some stretching. I realized I need to work on my fear of judgement. This can be done through slow exposure, but that plays right into me buying those shoes on aliexpress.

After work I felt bad and didnt want to do anything. I want to eat fats. Now I can feel like doing things. So i just had to wait.

Dr k says on those days where you cant do anything and feel super bad about it, but feel guilty for doing fun stuff. On this day accept it and choose that ur not going to accomplish anything.

I still didn't take enough breaks. THe focus + frustration combo got me again.
