Today I listned to dr k and woke up, and didnt look at my phone for almost an hour and a half. I did osme thinking and went for a walk and did some stretching. I realized I need to work on my fear of judgement. This can be done through slow exposure, but that plays right into me buying those shoes on aliexpress.
