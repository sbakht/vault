Day 2 of wear diapers and no twitch/youtube/reddit

I didnt wear last night since wearing at night can ruin it for me. I pooped myself again today, keeping it relaxed just feels much better then having to contract and hold it all in. It feels quite nice to keep it relaxed and just let the mushy warmness fill my backside. Honestly walking around in a messy diaper doesn't feel all that different. It might be because my poo is mushy, which normalizes it a bit.

This is all resulted from a lot of positive reinforcement from keeing it relaxed. This positive reinforcement could make untraining happen for real. I've gotten quite better and keeping it relaxed while moving, I figure it will be automatic within 3 weeks.
