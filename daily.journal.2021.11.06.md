## Why I stopped trying to name my emotions

I would read all these book and watch all these videos, and they would always say that you have to "name it to tame it". That first you have to identify the emotion and name it so you can respond properly. For me, this has been a disaster, and I finally started to make progress when I stopped trying to do that. So I still can't name my emotions but I'm getting better and faster at recognizing it earlier and earlier into the start of the emotion. I'm getting better at responding to it. For sure I've stopped myself from spiraling into a full day of negativity a few times.

So I hope this could help someone else that feels they HAVE to name their emotions. Its not necessarily the case that you need to, to make progress.
