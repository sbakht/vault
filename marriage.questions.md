**What is unforgivable before marriage? After marriage**

cheating, being judgemental of me without understanding. Judging my family or others unfairly. Using me against my family or them against me.

**What makes you feel vulnerable and what makes you feel safe?**

Vulnerable: Open display of negative emotions

Safe: dogs cause they are fluffy and warm

**What is off limits, only to be discussed with your partner?**

Trauma, preferences in intimacy. Trauma kinda includes alot of things so it covers alot. That includes fears, worry, anxiety, really anything to do with strong emotions. In laws too in some cases, but that kind of not really, it depends. Like telling the in law can help solve a problem.

**How do you express anger? What do you do when you are angry?**

By shutting down, walking away and not talking to anyone. For a number of reasons my mind determined this is the safest course of action from causing further harm. I'll walk away and play video games, twitch or listen to heavy metal. I find it difficult to return to baseline emotion, it takes the whole of the day. My attempt to fix this is to engage back immediately, but I do this cause it avoids causing a fight. So I guess I do this to avoid fights, but improving my emotional intelligence would let me have a conversation without fighting, but thats a long many year process of improving it. The problem is with my family that none of us have good emotional skills. So if anyone gets mad, it goes downhill fast so for me avoidance has been the best strategy.

**How do you make important and less important decisions in your life?**

So emotions are really the driver of decisions. I find it difficult to make a decision for things that I don't have a strong emotion for either eway. Also hard to make decisions for things that either conflict with what someone else wants, or what I THINK someone else wants. Other people are just as complicated so knowing what they want can be difficult, even if they tell you, which may not be the full truth.

I google and consult the internet when I can. This helps for things like buying products by looking at reviews and experiences. If it is something I don't really care either way, I'll let the person who cares more make the decision, like vacations. 

I factor price heavily into decisions. I'll procrastinate decisions on things that I can delay. Making decisions for things that have a clear islamic ruling, but my emotions feel the opposite is difficult. Those are reoccuring decisions that sometimes I make the right one and sometimes the emotions win. Its easy to make decisions that are both in the positive islamic direction and my emotions are inclined to.
