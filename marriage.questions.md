**What is unforgivable before marriage? After marriage*p*

cheating, being judgemental of me without understanding. Judging my family or others unfairly. Using me against my family or them against me.

**What makes you feel vulnerable and what makes you feel safe?**

Vulnerable: Open display of negative emotions

Safe: dogs cause they are fluffy and warm

**What is off limits, only to be discussed with your partner?**

Trauma, preferences in intimacy. Trauma kinda includes alot of things so it covers alot. That includes fears, worry, anxiety, really anything to do with strong emotions. In laws too in some cases, but that kind of not really, it depends. Like telling the in law can help solve a problem.

**How do you express anger? What do you do when you are angry?**

By shutting down, walking away and not talking to anyone. For a number of reasons my mind determined this is the safest course of action from causing further harm. I'll walk away and play video games, twitch or listen to heavy metal. I find it difficult to return to baseline emotion, it takes the whole of the day. My attempt to fix this is to engage back immediately, but I do this cause it avoids causing a fight. So I guess I do this to avoid fights, but improving my emotional intelligence would let me have a conversation without fighting, but thats a long many year process of improving it. The problem is with my family that none of us have good emotional skills. So if anyone gets mad, it goes downhill fast so for me avoidance has been the best strategy.

**How do you make important and less important decisions in your life?**

So emotions are really the driver of decisions. I find it difficult to make a decision for things that I don't have a strong emotion for either eway. Also hard to make decisions for things that either conflict with what someone else wants, or what I THINK someone else wants. Other people are just as complicated so knowing what they want can be difficult, even if they tell you, which may not be the full truth.

I google and consult the internet when I can. This helps for things like buying products by looking at reviews and experiences. If it is something I don't really care either way, I'll let the person who cares more make the decision, like vacations. 

I factor price heavily into decisions. I'll procrastinate decisions on things that I can delay. Making decisions for things that have a clear islamic ruling, but my emotions feel the opposite is difficult. Those are reoccuring decisions that sometimes I make the right one and sometimes the emotions win. Its easy to make decisions that are both in the positive islamic direction and my emotions are inclined to.

**Ways to handle finances while both are working?**

Both should be sharing money, separate or joint bank accounts need to be determined. I can see separate accounts with shared accounts as well, working. Guy paying for everything is big no no.

**Biggest fear about marriage**

Dont like the term biggest, but one fear is a big mismatch in intimacy, where the desires are so different that it cant be resolved. Another is having false expectations and trying to live up to them, thus failing cause the expectations are flawed from the start. Like expectations of never fighting, or having super communication. Me messing it up. Being taken advantage of cause of my personality type.

**Are you organized, cleanliness style?**

I don't mind having my clothes in a giant pile. I know where all my stuff is. I hate having lots of tabs open on the computer. 

**How culturaly traditional is ur family?**

We are totally not desi. Like the women are not serving tea. Will your family have a problem with that? For example, desi families might hate dogs

**Who is best friend, what i like about him?**

Friend from MSA, we play video games together. I like we both are programmers and play game. So we can discuss programming stuff, he likes my humour

**What makes you most insecure and how do you handle them**

My speaking and communication skills. My inability to say what I want or get my thoughts across. I don't really dea with this very well. Diaper desires. Liking cute baby and pastel stuff. My lack of muscles, but i also like it in some ways. Handling them is tough, like its just working on acceptance. Its a work in progress

**What are hobbies ud like to do with spouse?**

Playing certain video games like mario party and other fun co op games. Ice skating, giant trampoline places, laser tag, snowboarding.

**What is a moment in life that strengthend your faith in Allah?**

Getting a job that made it easy to pray. Both my jobs had a place to pray or a masjid near by. I made dua for this alot. Then in a more general sense, just seeing that I'm coming to conclusions that were already in the Quran. Such as that what stops people from accepting Islam is often times arrogance. All the evil in our times is just making Islam more clear for me.

**What is a moment that tested your faith in Allah?**

Hajj, that I didnt feel anything when seeing the Kaabah or in medinah. Alot of self hate from nofap and diapers, but thats not an issue anymore really. In general its my diaper desires and not sinning. Better answer is.

**How do you handle disagreements?**

If I can't convince them easily, I give up and wont try. I know im suppose to listen to their perspective and undersatnd it, but that is difficult. At work I'll give my viewpoint, but wont really push hard on it cause its work. Ultimately i don't really care about work, and I just give my view and thats it. Like there was a scenario where I used to own a codebase, and the new people have taken over, and are asking me how to do something. I tell them what they are doing is wrong, but its not my team so not really my decision.

**Easier to convey thoughts or feelings?**

Thoughts 100%

**What are the most important qualities looking for in a spouce?**

religious obviously, fun/playful, understanding, open minded, friendly

**What are ways you could improve your relationship with Allah?**

**Who are the greatest positive Islamic influences in your life?**

**Are you a do-it yourselfer, or would you rather hire professionals?**

**How often would guests come over to ur house?**

**Do you think you'd be the the harsh parent or the easy going parent?**
