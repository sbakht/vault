A mobile app will take a long time to build. Can we really volunteer for this? Seems like alot of effort. We might have to charge for more complex applications
Only providing UI for complex application would be beneficial

A UI and front end web development group that is a single source for islamic organizations to go to to get a UI design and or front end web development team to build a UI, improve a UI, or build a site.
UI design is faster then web development.
Can focus on just UI design for now
discord server to collaborate
  - channel for each project
How would we approve of projects?
  - would we have a leader ship team and everyone works together on a single project?
  - would we have single or few members volunteer to work on a project so X projects can be going on at same time, depending on how many people we have and who wants to do what
  - 2nd option seems better, to drive people to want to do it cause we cant force people to work on stuff
Design agency website 
  - to let islamic organizations contact us
  - showcase our previous projects
  - about page for each member and links to their own profiles/githubs/dribble
What we can provide will be based on volunteer skillsets
  - UI
  - UX
  - Icons
  - Illustrations/photos
  - Front End Dev
  - Back End Dev
   - CMS - wordpress/drupal






## Project Description

### Summary
The proposal is to create a website and app design agency to provide free, professional UI designs, for Islamic-based organizations. This is important because having high quality website/app is extremely important for an organizations user engagement. This will be accomplished through the creation a volunteer team of professional web designers and developers. We will then find organizations that need web design help or organizations will be able to find us through our website.

### Expanded summary
The proposal is to create a website/app design agency made up of volunteers who are professionals within the tech field. We aim to provide free, professional UI designs for Islamic-based organizations.  

We will be able to offer multiple services based on the skillset of the volunteers, but the primary goal is to offer User Interface Design, which translates to how the site/app looks. If we have programmers we can also offer to actually build the site/app itself. If the organization already has a website/app, we can offer to improve sections, or completely redesign it. If they don't yet have a website/app, we can create a design for them.

This project is needed because branding is extremely important to an organizations sucess. A high quality user interface will greatly improve user engagement with, and personal views of, the organization. 

We will have our own website for organizations to learn about us and contact us to start a conversation with our team. We will go over their vision for their brand, and offer to help them in ways that bring their vision to life.

### Relation To Tarbiyyah Program Topics
We had discussed wealth, rizq, and leaving a legacy, in the program. Our professional technical skills are a rizq from Allah and this project is an attempt to use those skills to benefit the Ummah. It will act as a ongoing charity that will benefit us long after we have died.

### Project Goals
Have a volunteer team of UI/UX designers. 
Optional: Have a team of programmers as well
Create a website where prospective clients can contact us and see what projects we have worked on
Successfully improve or redesign an existing website/app for an islamic organization
Work with an islamic organization to understand their needs, and subsequently design a website/app that fits their needs
Create a discord channel for volunteers to communicate and collaborate

### Execution Steps
Advertise on social media (reddit) to find volunteers
Create a discord channel for the members to collaborate
Ask on social media if any small islamic websites/apps think their design could be improved and would like our help
Design an improved website/app for them
Create our own website to allow organizations to learn about us, contact us and showcase projects we've completed
Advertise our website on social media
Use our network of volunteers to find those that need our help

### how to link project to existing organization in community or online
Our team can work with deendevelopers to get volunteers, network and collaborate on projects.

### Challenges
A big challenge we will face will be finding and creating a relationship with an organization that is looking for our help.
Retaining volunteers will also be a challenge. There will need to be a consistent amount of work over time otherwise people will forget and move on from our team.
A new organization may come to us for help, but have no real vision of their own. They would be offloading too much work on to our team which requires many more hours then a team of volunteers are able to provide. Example: We are contacted to design a new social media app for muslims. If they do not have a concrete plan on for implementation of their vision, we would have to deny our services to them.

### How to measure progress 
This can easily be measured by the amount of activity on our discord channel and the number of organizations we are working with or have worked with. What is most important will be the clients response to our new designs, weather they like it or not.


## PowerPoint Slides
- Title
  - Web Design Agency to help Islamic-based organizations
- High level summary
  - We will build a team of volunteer professional UI/UX designers
  - Help islamic organizations design their first, or redesign their existing, website/app
- Why UI/UX focus
  - We are primarily focusing on UI/UX due to time constraints
  - Full development of a website/app takes MANY hours
  - Volunteer teams have a limited number of hours they can give, so we are limiting our scope
  - There are many different skill sets within the industry
    - UI/UX - Our primary focus will be on UI/UX design
    - Software Engineers
    - Logo/Icon designers
    - Illustrators 
    - etc
- What is UI/UX design?
  - Creating the LOOK of the site
  - Design greatly influences the users engagement and perception of the website/app
  - The branding of a site influences a user's perception of the organization (Examples on next slides)
  - High quality website = High quality service/product
  - We need islamic organizations to have high quality websites/apps to improve their perception among muslims and non-muslims 
- Examples of sites
  - Tesla - https://www.tesla.com/
    - Very minimalistic and clean design, just like the design of their cars
  - Fall guys - https://www.fallguys.com/en-US
    - Bright, plaful colors
    - Fun design
    - Indicates it something family friendly and fun
  - AlMaghrib
    - Something about changing my life? - Will attract people who want a life changing experience
    - You can see people together, being happy
    - Suggestion: Have an indicator the user can scroll down (down arrow)
      - Make the text bigger since there is a lot of empty space
- Project Goals
 - Build a team of volunteer UI/UX designers
 - Optional: Build a team of software engineers as well
 - Create a website for our organization

  - Showcase our previous client projects
 - Successfully make design improvements to an existing Islamic website/app

- Challenges
  - Finding and connecting with organizations that need and want our help
  - Retaining volunteer engagement
    - Time constraints
    - Not enough projects so volunteers lose interest 
  - New organizations without a strong vision will offload too much work onto us
    - Can avoid this by only working with established organizations at first
