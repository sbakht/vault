## Ingredients

### Primary

- 1 cup sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1/4 cup carrots, peeled and diced
- 1/4 cup onions, chopped
- 1 cup veggie broth from cooked vegetables
- 1/2 cup raw cashews OR 1/2 cup cooked white beans

### Additions

- 4 tablespoons nutrition yeast flakes
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- pinch paprika
- 1/2 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

Begin by peeling and dicing the sweet potatoes. They can be a little tricky to peel, so a potato peeler may be just what you need to keep those fingers safe.

Dice up the onion carrots. Personally, we usually have baby carrots on hand for snacking, so I tend to just include a few of those and don’t even cut them up.

Place the diced vegetables in a stockpot with enough water to cover them well. Cook on medium-high heat until they are tender which should be around 15-minutes depending on the size of the chunks of potatoes.

Once they are cooked, drain the water from them but reserve 1 cup of the broth to use in the recipe.

Next, add all the ingredients–cooked sweet potatoes, onions, carrots, and cashews (or white beans), along with the spices and seasonings in a food processor or blender.

Allow it to process in the blender until creamy smooth. It will continue to thicken as it cools and especially after refrigeration.
