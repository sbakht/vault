> Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your [full] compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained [his desire]. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion.
- https://quran.com/3/185

Purpose vs calling

Islam is purpose and we know that but what is your calling

Everyone in a group needs to have the same purpose for the group to have a unified goal, which is necessary to achieve it.

Fulfil your potential, not someone elses

what is the link between purpose & potential in life?

What is the link between purpose and emotional states?

The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said, "How wonderful is the case of a believer; there is good for him in everything and this applies only to a believer. If prosperity attends him, he expresses gratitude to Allah and that is good for him; and if adversity befalls him, he endures it patiently and that is better for him".

death of community -> no same purpose for everyone -> no friend groups -> negative emotions

My purpose and the purpose of the abdl group is different which is why I'm able to stay away from them, desipete our same "local purpose" in diapers.

Modern day purpose = materialism
