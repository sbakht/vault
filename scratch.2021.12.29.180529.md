Do i not care about low quality cause i say its because im not wanting the dunya? Was i like this before islam? Maybe i am but its a new justificationo for old habits? If this causes a negative experience, then a negative relation with Islam is created. Its ok that I am this way, dont let anyone say other wise. But there is also times where I should go for something better. Best option here is to remove Islam from this. Islam doesn't really effect this. Others would argue that it does, like for wearing nice clothes. But I think this is a smaller issue that doesn't deserve that much value. Its a samskara that is giving it more value then it deserves.



Samskars
- crying is weakness
- naps are weakness
- asking "how im doing" when im mad/sad
 - positivity
  - that islam book
- accepting compliments
- therapy
- doing high quality things like high quality picture

I almost cant differentiate between sad and mad. MAd is high energy sad. Sad is low energy mad. Tired is low energy sad

I'm bad at speaking cause my mom is bad at speaking english. Why aren't my sisters? They are but they aren't at my level. They are different people. They are women, im a guy and a programmer. I'm already inclined for weak speaking.

Difficulty is what makes you stronger. Having kids and taking difficulty away will make them fail, then will then encouter difficulty. What you want to do is expose them to difficulty in a training setting, so they can practice against it. This is just like how therapy works. 

Pracice is the act of doing something in a low stakes environment multiple times, until you can easily do it in a high stakes environment.

Secularists actually attack problems, not muslims. Muslims just ignore them. This comes from muslims avoiding the truth, pretending we are in perfection, so we can't fix anything.

I'm resistant to doing alot of the techniques to overcome freeze response like giving an alternate story or watching a video on grounding behavior and doing that. I should work on breaking the emotional response to "alternate story".
