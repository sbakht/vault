So I asked myself about a scenario that I was suppose to think about how i would react, but I can't remember the question. This shows how fast things go away. I'm trying to as ak question and vary the situation a little bit each time to pull out what my values are and how I would answer differently each time.

### The scenario where I see a \$100 bill on the ground

I answer this differently based on how many people i see around me. What i will do is always check if there are people around. This shows I'm worried about peoples judgement.

### Exercise

I have done a bad job about exercising. Today though I played smash and did some pushups and pullups in between. I will do some more now to make up for not completing everything isntead of feeling sad about it and failing yet again.

### Journaling

I like this journaling thing so far, if it gets me to exercise then this is good!

So I'm still procrastinating exericse or getting food. Right now I'm going through that gaming javascript game (https://yare.io/). Lets stop since I don't actually want to do this RIGHT now, but later sure. I'm saving the link here so we are all good.

I grabbed a reeses cup to eat, but I forgot about it and just remembered it. I see it sitting on my desk but I'm writing this to get myself to not eat it. I'm feeling the same for eating popcorn too. I ended up eating the popcorn but I tried to be aware of it.

I said that I wouldn't be able to get myself to listen to a recording of me talking to a girl so I could remember what she said. Why is this? This is cause I don't want to hear my voice and I never listen to recordings of anything really. It feels wrong and I don't want ot hear myself. It is weird cause its a 3rd person view into something that I was first person within. Is it necessarily wrong? No but it is good to understand why my feelings are that way.

### Diapers

Today I told a guy to fuck off. Some muslim guy mssaged me with "bruh" and i felt the judgement. He deserved it really.
