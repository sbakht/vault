I dream about logically beating out therapists and making them fail. I want to be the most difficult challenge anyone has faced, logically atleast. Why? It proves that I'm messed up that I beat a therapist. Validation?

I dont want others to know that i have emotions. I want to be a robot.

If i gain perception of emotions, like knowing the room is hot. I don't want to be a complainer like people I know.
