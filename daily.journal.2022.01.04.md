I dream about logically beating out therapists and making them fail. I want to be the most difficult challenge anyone has faced, logically atleast. Why? It proves that I'm messed up that I beat a therapist. Validation?

I dont want others to know that i have emotions. I want to be a robot.

If i gain perception of emotions, like knowing the room is hot. I don't want to be a complainer like people I know.

-----------------------------------------

feel bad. cant exercise. hate myself. face hurts. mouth open, still as a rock. dead as a robot. fake journal to feel worse, ignoring body when feeling so stop being hungry. deleting threads at first sign of not wanting me there. disappearing quickly, leaving the situation, not wanted, not needed, good. imaginary scenarios to get mad. I duno what to describe. Cant trust therapy, false diagnosis. muslim therapists judgemental. massive fear of judgement. I dont want an excuse cause i have a therapy diagnosis like autistic or something. Allah does everything for a reason, spiritual bypass, i duno?. Any time u use islam to justify something, becareful. What do i do then, hadith seem dangerous now?

I actually want diapers and being a baby. Its a lie to say I want to quit the fetish. thats why it creats such negative feelings. I dont want to stop, but i need to.
