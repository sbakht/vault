*Steps to create arabic negation from english*

**Neither of you will go**

1. Identify the verb
2. Translate the verb to basic form
3. Get right tense of verb (there is a problem here cause the harf can change you to use present when using lam)
3. Get the right form of verb from gender and plurality
4. Identify any harf needed for meaning
5. Modify verb if needed by the harf
	- go back to step 3 if needed
