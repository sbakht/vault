day 1

Its day 1 and i already have desires to wear to bed again. Its 60% wear 40% dont wear. Like i really want to wear. Now I'm going to put rationalizations as to why I should wear. I should stay away from the pacifier though since that ruined my sleep I think. Get consistent at wetting the bed then think about introducing the paci. I don't actually need the paci to sleep so its a false requirement.

End of day - Day 1 was a success, I still want to wear like 90%/10% so I am going to wear, even though I didnt do any looking or fantasizing. If I can keep wearing without it going sexual, then I'm ok with this.
