## Not Doing

- [ ] Go through https://yare.io/

I just created a smoothie from the mango/peanch/pineapple/strawberry frozne fruits from costco. It doesn't taste AMAZINGLY fruity but it taste pretty good enough. I could probably add some lemon or something to make it great. Its a good healthy base to get fruits from.

I did some buteyko breathing/meditation, think I was falling asleep though which makes sense since I feel tired.

## Why didn't I take breaks today?

1. I focused too much on the code
2. The code was frustrating me
3. The yoga lady voice was frustrating me

It seems frustration + focus is dangerous for me. I want to focus but I want to not focus so I could do other htings as well. Too much and too little focus is bad, or is it. High focus is good but I need to be able to stop it. I think 25 minutes is too short for me. Lets try 50 minutes of work and 10 minutes of break. That seems better for me. Lets try that out and see how it goes.
