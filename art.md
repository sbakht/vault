Think of Quran like an escape room

**When there are 2 name pairings in a verse, ask this:**

1. Why these 2 names
2. Why in this order instead of reversed
3. Why not in the ayah before or after
4. Why are they in this order, when its usually in the opposite order


https://quran.com/79/42-46

## Dhikr is a 3 stage process

- perception
		understanding
- reflection
- expression

There is a kufr tv show (good place). You see it, perceive the evil that it is. You reflect on it and recognize the truth. Then say astagfirullah. This is self awareness AND dhikr. You should be aware of your internal state and emotional reaction. If the reaction isn't what you want it to be, make dua that Allah makes it to the desired state. Don't spiral into emotional freakout.

Seek forgivness for when you are self aware of your mistakes, also when you are unaware cause you are aware of your lack of full self awareness.
