I relapsed today, then looked at stuff again without orgasm so i call that 2 relapses

Solution: phone blockers didnt work out, I was able to get around it, then got aroused and removed it. My solution is to GET UP when I have an urge.

# day 0


HUGE WIN - I broke through the negative state and was able to sign up for therapy AND message her - See below for how I did it. I'm not sure exactly what did it. I was watching dr k at the same time, watching the doomer episode. Maybe that had an impact?

who what where when why

Problem: Signing up for therapy
do i want to do do it? yes but also no, this is where the chaos comes from


What is an ideal muslim?
they consider God in all their actions
they repent when they inevtiable fuck up, then they move on and don't think about it
they do a good deed after fucking up
they think alot but also take a lot of action
  this is a contadiction. Ignore this line
lower their gaze -> ask for forgivness after messing up -> basic istigfar
they arent depressed during istigfar, they dont worrk and are hopeful instead

Problem: I should message her but dont want to
Im more available to message her then i was an hour ago
do i want to do it? Kind of, Like i should, but do i want to? I dont want to start a long conversation but what to give her some info
can i get myself to start? I could give a small update

Problem: I'm getting anxiety spikes whenever i think about her response
Can i control what i think about? not really
So what do i do about it? nothing really, just breathe
