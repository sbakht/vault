## Why was I unable to stay awake after fajr?

It is sunday, i got up after 9 pm. 

Was out with padela the day before, so could be from being tired. 

Could it be risidual necessary sleep from lack from lack fo sleep from days past? 

It was cloudy so no nice sun to wake me up. Temperature was neutral.

Drank water but went to sleep anyway. I also drank alot of water before sleeping i think

Did I not have a strong dopamine hit to keep me awake? Paicfier buying options didn't get me to stay awake.

The beef kabab we ate with padela could of caused it?

Avoding wearing diapers caused it?

Allah forgive me for not staying awake after fajr

## Why did I buy the fixx pacifier despite doing universal man?

My desire for the paci bypassed the breathing technique. My desire for it is greater. I'm justifying it that the paci is harmless, the female wont mind that I use it, and its more like a stuffie then diapers. The breathing will only work if I want it to. Why do i want it to work for diapers but not paci? If I saw the new little kings come out would I buy them? Yes I would, or atleast watch lots of videos of it. So I'm not fully ready to quit yet.
 
Allah forgive me for getting the paci

## Why am I anxious about the meeting with girl?


## Why do i not get haircut at beard guy?

## Pizza time

Sohail asked me if i want pizza, i said ok. He then says to order from where I want.

I only want it cause there is no effort involved. Once I have to put in effort, my decision making process kicks in. Before that I was passive so I just let unhealthy thing happen to me.

Having to put in effort makes me consider more parameters. There is a blocker to the dopamine.
