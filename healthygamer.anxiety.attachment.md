## Me

I fall under the anxious-ambivalent or avoidant one. I'm not sure which one of those exactly.

## Dr k Guide pdf

Some people have an anxious personality that develops through childhood experiences. What we learn in childhood shapes our comprehension of the world and how we view relationships. Children pick up on the emotional responses from caregivers. Based on the facial expressions of the people around them, they generate an understanding of the world. In Attachment Theory, the type of emotional mirroring children receive determines their attachment style and explains how some people develop an anxious personality.

## Notes

We learn about our emotions and how to react from mirroring parents. All adults have extreme facial reactions when dealing with kids, which makes sense since it helps train them.

Insecure attachment comes from confused emotional signals, those that are random. This teaches the kid they can't really understand how the world is and how it reacts to them. This gives them high level of danger warning since stuff could be dangerous.

Anxious-ambivalent are independent and against vulnerability. They give mixed signals to people, sometimes craving attachement and other times pushing them away. Caused by inconsistent response from caregivers. _This seems the same as insecure attachment?_

Avoidant is caused by caregivers who are unavailable, who don't respond well to emotional needs.
