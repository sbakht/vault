day 2

So I wore diapers last night and it was GREAT. 10/10, but i missed fajr :(. I kept waking up throughout the night and peeing apparently cause I dont remember doing a big pee at any point. Though i kept waking up and having to shift my position, so I'm not entirely used to wearing the bulky diaper yet. It was too much warmth and pressure. Its something my body will get used to over time. But I woke up feeling super happy. I don't understand why. When there is no sexual component i LOVE diapers and have no real guilt over them. Is it ok for me to wear in this instance? It seems ok to me, but this therapy thing has me sus. I dont know how therapist will react. I want them to not respond to me so i can go to a kink aware one, but I know they will support me if I say i want to keep doing it. Honestly I loved it and will wear tonight. I love it because it felt comfy, warm and relaxing. It just felt better to pee tiny bits throughout the night. Waking up and not having to pee felt great. I'm going to wear tonight again. I wonder what will happen once I get to the point where its normalized and bedwetting becomes normal. Will I no longer enjoy it? Most likely what will happen is that I will still get the calming and joyful benefits from it, but it will be less pronounced.
