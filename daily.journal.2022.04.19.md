## notes for Ayesha

she mentioned many times about us not having family over
  - family is casuall, they can open fridge, how are her family gatherings
  - she isnt family, should the expectation be different
what family dynamic and culture is different?

what was off-putting and awkward that we did?
Who's houses were these parties at? Family? Friends? how big? What did you do there?

## stuff that pissed me off
norms that werent present was off putting and awkward

hesitancy in staying a night?
  - she never offered to stay at her house
  - first plan and final plan involved us staying there

mentioning that meeting your dad in the store isnt respectful
  - this wasn't even the final plan
  - you aren't respectful of my mom

saying my family didn't care or value you
  - if we didnt care my mom wouldn't of invited you
  - we made sure ur borther didnt feel bad about not praying

i dont know how the norms would play out in the long run
  - what does this mean?
  - you are saying we are on the same page but my family isnt? so they are the problem?

my family didnt put their best foot forward
  - guess we shouldn't of invited you then

stand up for your spouse, children, inlaws to your family
  - why are my inlaws more important then MY family
  - where is this sentence coming from, what are you referring to?

its not fair to judge a person based on their family
  - this is you straight up attacking my family

i have control on how i respond to their behavior
  - what behavior exactly?
  
"ask your muslim friends to proceed with any of the suggestisons"
- who said we are just visting your mom??? That wasn't the plan
