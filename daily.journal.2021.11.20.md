Well I procrastinated making a journal entry about the first week of tarbiyah program. Since then I've recommited to my sub purpose of creating the best arabic site. I'm focusing on learning purescript first.

I've also started my bedwetting and full time diapering plan again where i wear for atleast 8 hours a day and at night, but I dont drink extra during the day.

## Todo
- [ ] purescript lessons
- [ ] clean up bed
- [x] put baby lotion with the diapers
- [ ] fantasy land blog posts
- [ ] go to halal finance class
