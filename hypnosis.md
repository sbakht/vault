## Refer to yourself as you, not i
You are becoming relaxed instead of I am becoming relaxed

## Start with statement you know to be true then use "and" to add a sentence to make it true.

"The sky is blue and you are starting to feel relaxed"

Do not use the word "but"

## Use words and phrases associted with sinking, dropping down, falling or releasing

"sinking deeper", "gradually letting go of control" "releasing all tension"

Combine with visualization of going down steps or something

## Imprinting
Use "and you may" to increase chance of acceptance and doens't break immersion if you dont

"You can feel relaxed and you may start to feel confident"

You can combine this with visualization by visualizing confidence. The white light you represents your confidence you and see it growing and getting bigger
