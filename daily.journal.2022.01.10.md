Unresolved anger for being emotionally repressed

unresolved anger/fear? for being only taught about hell and being traumatized for it

When i don't know what to do next (confusion?) I go to what feels safe which is reddit youtube, twitch, abdl, diapers. Which i pick is depending on futher emotions.

Emotion is energy, it translates into something else like porn desire, food desire if the emotional energy is not harnessed or consiously converted into what you want. If you can consiously convert it you would be super powerful.

I looked at porn today, but didnt fully relapse so I'm resetting, but notbad.jpg
