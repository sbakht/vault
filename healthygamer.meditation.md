### Dr K meditation that he does every day

Ask your self over and over _What is the next best step I can take?_

This works because it goes over what I CAN do, accepting that I'm not perfect. Maybe its throwing out garbage or something simple.

Some days you win, some days you lose

Get up and go for a walk in the morning and don't use phone or computer for an hour in the morning first thing. Notice how your mind will do anything to convince you to try to go on the computer.

Mandala - build something beautiful and destroy it. Don't take a picture or preserve it in anyway. This will detach you from things. Once reading this I deleted a note I made here in dendron.
