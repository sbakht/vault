Assalam Alaykum guys. I got a question regarding the perfect character of the Prophet (saw). I'm amazed by and have trouble understanding how he was able perfect communication with everyone, to the point that no one had a single complaint about his manners or character. We all know from experience that everyone has emotional trigger points, and its incredibly easy (especially today) to offend someone by your words even when you have the best intention. You could say things perfectly and they could still be offended. I'm trying to understand how the Prophet (saw) was able to do this perfectly, such that even the kuffar had nothing to say against his manners or speech. How was he able to communicate Islam to them in such an amazing way? Like we all know that politics and religion are the 2 dangerous topics, but that goes even doubly for Islam in a idol-worshipping society. Rasullah (saw) would have to know how to communicate with each individual uniquely since each person responds differently. If this is just a miracle from Allah, then we can leave it at that, but is there more to it then that?
