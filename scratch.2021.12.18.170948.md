**Ways to handle finances while both are working?**

Both should be sharing money, separate or joint bank accounts need to be determined. I can see separate accounts with shared accounts as well, working. Guy paying for everything is big no no.

**Biggest fear about marriage**

Dont like the term biggest, but one fear is a big mismatch in intimacy, where the desires are so different that it cant be resolved. Another is having false expectations and trying to live up to them, thus failing cause the expectations are flawed from the start. Like expectations of never fighting, or having super communication. Me messing it up. Being taken advantage of cause of my personality type.

**Are you organized, cleanliness style?**

I don't mind having my clothes in a giant pile. I know where all my stuff is. I hate having lots of tabs open on the computer. 

**How culturaly traditional is ur family?**

We are totally not desi. Like the women are not serving tea. Will your family have a problem with that? For example, desi families might hate dogs

**Who is best friend, what i like about him?**

Friend from MSA, we play video games together. I like we both are programmers and play game. So we can discuss programming stuff, he likes my humour

**What makes you most insecure and how do you handle them**

My speaking and communication skills. My inability to say what I want or get my thoughts across. I don't really dea with this very well. Diaper desires. Liking cute baby and pastel stuff. My lack of muscles, but i also like it in some ways. Handling them is tough, like its just working on acceptance. Its a work in progress

**What are hobbies ud like to do with spouse?**

Playing certain video games like mario party and other fun co op games. Ice skating, giant trampoline places, laser tag, snowboarding.

**What is a moment in life that strengthend your faith in Allah?**

Getting a job that made it easy to pray. Both my jobs had a place to pray or a masjid near by. I made dua for this alot. Then in a more general sense, just seeing that I'm coming to conclusions that were already in the Quran. Such as that what stops people from accepting Islam is often times arrogance. All the evil in our times is just making Islam more clear for me.

**What is a moment that tested your faith in Allah?**

Hajj, that I didnt feel anything when seeing the Kaabah or in medinah. Alot of self hate from nofap and diapers, but thats not an issue anymore really. In general its my diaper desires and not sinning. Better answer is

**How do you handle disagreements?**

If I can't convince them easily, I give up and wont try. I know im suppose to listen to their perspective and undersatnd it, but that is difficult. At work I'll give my viewpoint, but wont really push hard on it cause its work. Ultimately i don't really care about work, and I just give my view and thats it. Like there was a scenario where I used to own a codebase, and the new people have taken over, and are asking me how to do something. I tell them what they are doing is wrong, but its not my team so not really my decision.

**Easier to convey thoughts or feelings?**

Thoughts 100%

**What are the most important qualities looking for in a spouce?**

religious obviously, fun/playful, understanding, open minded, friendly
