A mobile app will take a long time to build. Can we really volunteer for this? Seems like alot of effort. We might have to charge for more complex applications
Only providing UI for complex application would be beneficial

A UI and front end web development group that is a single source for islamic organizations to go to to get a UI design and or front end web development team to build a UI, improve a UI, or build a site.
UI design is faster then web development.
Can focus on just UI design for now
discord server to collaborate
  - channel for each project
How would we approve of projects?
  - would we have a leader ship team and everyone works together on a single project?
  - would we have single or few members volunteer to work on a project so X projects can be going on at same time, depending on how many people we have and who wants to do what
  - 2nd option seems better, to drive people to want to do it cause we cant force people to work on stuff
Design agency website 
  - to let islamic organizations contact us
  - showcase our previous projects
  - about page for each member and links to their own profiles/githubs/dribble
