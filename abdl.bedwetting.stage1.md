## SMART Goal

Starting 2021.11.13

I will wake up and wet at night 3 days a week without wearing a diaper. I will accomplish this in 3 weeks. I will change clothes and sheets after wetting. I will keep 2 pairs of clothes, 1 for changing into after wetting, and another for changing into for fajr. I will know i accomplish this when I can wakeup and wet multiple times a week without running to the bathroom.

- Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
  - Wake up in the middle of the night and pee without getting out of bed
  - I want it and makes me feel good and childish and is exciting
  - I will wet without wearing diapers
  - I will need a backup blanket incase mine gets wet
  - I will allow myself to remove the peapod pad and change blankets after wetting
  - I will need to change clothes and clean myself if I change the sheets. I will either need to go to the bathroom or have backup clothes which I will have to change again for fajr
- Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
  - I will wet 3 nights a week
  - I will sleep under the pad to make wetting an easy choice
  - I will know its accomplished when I can wakeup and pee when I have a full bladder 3 days in a row
- Achievable (agreed, attainable).
  - I will have to do laundry multiple days. I will do laundry in the morning, no one will notice if i'm wetting 3 days and doing laundry instead of 7
  - I will keep backup clothes setup for easy changing
  - How can I accomplish this goal?
  - Cost is not an issue since replacing clothes and pads are easy
- Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
  - Changing clothes in the middle of hte night is high effort, but low time cost. This will make diapers more alluring since they are convienent
  - I have the time to do this and want it
- Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).
  - Accomplish within 3 weeks
  - First week is trying it out
  - 2nd week is getting used to it
  - 3rd week is normalizing it and increasing the frequency

### What do I need to do now

- [x] setup pad
- [x] set out pajamas, backup pajamas, fajr clothes
- [x] set an alarm for 4 am in case I dont wet before that
- [ ] setup backup blanket
- [x] drink 1.5 large glasses of water before sleeping



## Update

So on the first night after wetting, i ended up orgasming and stopped my plan immediately.
Now its 2021.11.20 and im starting up hypno and doing my plan to wear diapers every day for atleast 8 hours
