# Pre Ramadan Planning

## Goals


1. Less youtube
2. Less reddit
3. Less twitch*
4. No diapers or porn*
5. Read Quran*
6. Morning and Evening dhikr *
7. Dhikr app
8. Taraweeh
9. All sunnah prayers*


### Trick

These 9 all take precedence before and over exercise and eating healthy. DO NOT sacrifice any of then in order to fit in a workout or to eat healthier. Spend my limited willpower on these things instead of exercise or eating healthy, or not playing video games.

Example: skipping taraweeh to workout

What about sleep? Will have to readjust after a few days and see how its going

### Less Reddit

Pros of reddit: 
1. Fills the time when waiting for something to happen or nothing to do
2. Crowdsource information
  - news on games, videos, world
  - buying product information
  - advice (usually worthless tbh)
3. Gain new perspective and learn things (also a con)

Cons of reddit:
1. You 90% of the time spend more time then necessary, once the waiting for activity is over ur wasiting time on reddit
2. Become more extreme in ideologies
  - learn false information
  - bias view of the world
3. weakens ability to not have constant stimulation

We can have both pros and mitigate cons by limiting time allowed to reddit to certain hour of the day. Can't get distracted since it will be blocked. When it is available we can plan to use it for some searches we need to do. What if i waste all the time when its unblocked? That is allowed since it is planned for and not random. We can decrease from there in the future.

Points of failure:
1. using proxy to bypass blockers
2. needing a distraction - play video games instead or watch tv

Plan: Limit to 1 hour a day, 30min will overlap with youtube. Keep porn subreddits blocked all time.

### Less Youtube

Pros of youtube: 
1. Fills the time when waiting for something to happen or nothing to do
2. Crowdsource information
  - news on games, videos, world
  - buying product information
3. has workouts
4. podcasts while doing other things
5. ertainment while chilling out
6. entertainment to fill literally any desire 

Cons of youtube:
1. spend too much time on it
2. you can start with good intention but end up somewhere you don't want to be and waste time 
3. weakens ability to not have constant stimulation - BIG ONE compared to reddit
4. high visual and auditory stimulation
5. can satisfy any desire - bad for nafs

It seems youtube has some stronger pros then reddit, but it has extremely detremental cons. Although reddit has porn which youtube doesn't (not for me that is, but still doesn't compare). Youtube is more easily passed off as beneifical when its not good for you, which makes it more dangerous. Its more clear what your doing is bad when using reddit. Unblocking youutbe will open up youtube porn. I don't have a solution for this. Since the time is scheduled I might be better at not falling into it mindlessly.

Plan: Limit to 1 hour a day, 30min will overlap with reddit. If I start going to youutbe porn, then switch to tv, video games or twitch.

### Less Twitch

Pros of twitch: 
1. entertainment when im tired, sick or dont want to do anything 
2. great for when im eating food

Cons of youtube:
1. spend too much time on it, continue to watch after eating food
2. i use it when tired or low energy instead of solving the energy issue

Twitch is pretty simple and less of a problem then others. Its entertainment when im low energy. I will be low energy alot while fasting so I need a good replacement. Its literally a tv replacement, but is tv a better choice? Better to prefer video games over tv. Active video games are good, not ones like tf2 which has hte same purpose as twitch.

Plan: Limit to 1.5 hour a day. Same time as youtube + reddit. Use active video games (not tf2) as a replacement. Use audiobooks as replacement.

### No diapers or porn 

Pros of no diapers or porn: 
1. OMG they feel so good 
2. satisfy craving - but makes em worse 

Cons of no diapers or porn: 
1. intense cravings 
2. no diapers :(

Do I allow the pacifier? It seems like a slippery slope. So no, i know exactly how this will go.

Plan: Its going to be alot harder with all the blocks, but that wont fully secure it. Think about how I will have to give amizan money. I dont really know, these cravings get intense. Distract myself with video games, its the only way. 

### Read Quran

Pros of read Quran 
1. good deeds 
2. improved life 

Cons of reading Quran 
1. takes time 
2. feel bad if i dont do it  - just dont feel bad

Make a specific time to do it. Mornings wont work for me, it never does. Late night doesnt work either, i dont feel like it. 12 pm seems good.

Plan: Read Quran for 20 minutes at 12pm 

### Morning/Evening dhikr

Pros of morning/evening dhikr 
1. good deeds 
2. improved life 

cons of morning/evening dhikr 
1. takes time 
2. feel bad if i dont do it  - just dont feel bad

Make a specific time to do it. Mornings are hard. Do it right after fajr.  

TODO create an easy document that has all the dhikr listed. Easy, medium, hard

Plan: Dhikr read right after fajr, and right after asr


### Dhikr app

Plan: 100 each. read after each salah, replacement as reddit/youtube dsitraction, while waiting for iftar, waiting for taraweeh


### Taraweeh

Just go - need car

### Sunnah prayers

Make it a priority

## Major blockers

emotional state fluctuations and tiredness. Prioritize these things and if you really can't do it, then don't. But know that the emotional will change again so dont let it stop you from succeeding tomorrow.
