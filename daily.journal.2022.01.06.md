**Which style or styles feel most familiar to you? Did you identify strongly
with one distinct response (fight, flight, freeze) or with a mix of different
responses?**

I've felt I was a freeze type of guy, but reading the descriptions, I'm not so sure. I for sure do flee and freeze, but those descriptions don't really fit. I guess I shouldn't worry too much about the descriptions. I do think freeze is mostly the scenario of what I do.

**Can you think of a time when your survival instincts helped you out?**

This is kinda tough. I can think of examples where the reaction wasnt needed, like seeing the snake.

I'm recognizing a pattern that I have low energy around 6pm. This seems to happen after walks, but is that just a coincidence of walk timing, or something related? Also seems to be when I had poor sleep, but also needs testing.


## Grounding exercise

We have mind (nafs), body and spirit. Each one needs to be tackled to improve at something. For grouding exercise we have deep breathing. This attacks the mind and the body, but misses out on the spirit. We know that dhikr, in it the hearts find rest. I assume this means the ruh? So dhikr + breathing will attack all 3 and be the best combo.
