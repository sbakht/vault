Some people have an anxious personality that develops through childhood experiences. What we learn in childhood shapes our comprehension of the world and how we view relationships. Children pick up on the emotional responses from caregivers. Based on the facial expressions of the people around them, they generate an understanding of the world. In Attachment Theory, the type of emotional mirroring children receive determines their attachment style and explains how some people develop an anxious personality.
