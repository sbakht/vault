The qibla direction being changed was a huge worldivew shift for them. For us, its whatever which is why it was such a big deal for them.

Your world view will dictate what you think about things. You must understand one's worldview through communication before u can reach them.

#### Concepts of a world view (ordered by importance)

- ontology - what exists?
- epistemology - what is knowledge?

- teleology
- morality/ethics

What makes a man more value then a potato? You can't if ur a materialist

When asked to describe what is art, everyone mentioned visual things like paintings. Music is there too I guess.
In islam hearing is primary, that is interesting concidering the rulings on music. We view it differently I guess?
