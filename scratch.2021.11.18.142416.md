Saad, ExpSDK should be available for you to use. depending on if its server side experiment, you will need some xapi changes depending on your project.

just a caveat, our current ExpSDK is gonna bring over jQ and your bundle will increase. We are identifying scope with the Exp team to rewrite the sdk for vue apps using async/await. No ETA as of now.
